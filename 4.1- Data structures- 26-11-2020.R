# Data structure in R
# Data come in many types and structures which can pose a problem for some analysis environments but R handles them with ease.

#Vector
#The most common data structure ia the one dimensional vector
# Vector forms the basis of everything in R.
# A vector is collection of elements of same type.
# A vector cannot be of mixed type.
# R is a Vectorized Language. That means operations are applied to each element of the vector automatically,
# without the need to loop through the vector.
# This is a powerful concept and vector plays a crucial and significant role in R.
#Common way to write vectors is by putting c

#Data frame# Data Frames(DF) - Most useful features of R & also cited reason for R's ease of use.
# In dataframe, each column is actually a vector, each of which has same length.
# Each column can hold different type of data.
# Also within each column, each element must be of same type, like vectors.
#Multiple vectors having different kind of data like characters
#Example- Excel spreadsheet

#Matrices
# A matrix is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbol, or expression arrange in rows & columnns (2 dimensional)
#Vector + data frame
#Here matrix can be  multiplied with different columns 

#Arrays
#An array is essentially a multidimensional vector
# It must all be of the same type
# individual elements are accessed using square bracket

##List 
# Stores any number of items of any types
#List can contains all numerics or characters
#a mix of the data.frames or recursively other lists
